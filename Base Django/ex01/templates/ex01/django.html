  <h2>Django Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Django is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
    It follows the <strong>Model-View-Template (MVT)</strong> architectural pattern and is known for its emphasis on 
    <strong>"don't repeat yourself" (DRY)</strong> principles, reusable code, and built-in features that streamline web development.
    Django includes tools for authentication, URL routing, an ORM for database interactions, and an automatic admin interface, 
    making it ideal for developers who want to focus on building their applications without reinventing common web development components.
  </p>

  <h2>History of Django</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2003:</strong> Django began as an internal project at a news organization called the Lawrence Journal-World in Kansas, USA. 
      Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, web developers at the news site, created Django to meet the fast-paced needs of web development for news publishing.</li>
    
    <li><strong>2005:</strong> Recognizing its usefulness for the wider community, Django was open-sourced under the BSD license in July 2005. 
      It was named after the famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt.</li>
    
    <li><strong>2008:</strong> The Django Software Foundation (DSF) was established to maintain and manage the project. 
      Since then, Django has been maintained by a community of developers who ensure its continued growth and stability.</li>
    
    <li><strong>2011:</strong> Django 1.3 introduced class-based views, making it easier to reuse views across different projects.</li>
    
    <li><strong>2015:</strong> Django 1.8 became a Long Term Support (LTS) release and brought numerous features like native support for multiple template engines and enhancements to the ORM.</li>
    
    <li><strong>2017:</strong> Django 2.0 marked a significant milestone by dropping support for Python 2, signaling a shift toward modern development practices and better performance.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Present:</strong> Django continues to be one of the most popular Python frameworks for building robust, secure, and scalable web applications, with a strong ecosystem and frequent updates.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Django's strengths lie in its <strong>"batteries-included"</strong> philosophy, which provides developers with a wide array of tools and 
    features to build powerful web applications quickly and securely.
